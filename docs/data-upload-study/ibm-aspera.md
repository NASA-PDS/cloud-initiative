# IBM Aspera Research Report on ATLAS Data Transfer

-   **(1) License Type**:

    -   \(a\) IBM Aspera offers different plans:

        -   (i)  **On-demand**: Pay for usage as needed.

        -   \(ii\) **Subscription**-based: Suitable for ongoing or
            periodic usage.

    -   \(b\) For a one-time transfer (e.g.,  few PB ATLAS backlog data)
        , we have 2 options:

        -   (i)  **Pay-as-you-go**: Best for occasional, short-term
            needs.

        -   **(ii) Short-term Subscription** plan: Depends on transfer
            requirements and duration.

-   **(2) Data Size and Speed**:

    -   \(a\) Charges may include costs based on:

        -   (i)   **Data volume**: The total size of data being
            transferred.

        -   (ii)  **Transfer speed**: Higher speeds incur additional
            costs.

        -   \(iii\) **Duration of usage**: Charges increases with
            prolonged use.

-   **(3) Additional Costs**:

    -   \(a\) If the migration involves encrypting or preprocessing
        data, there could be additional charges.

    -   \(b\) Potential additional IBM Aspera charges for storage or
        other services during the transfer process.

-   **(4) Cost analysis**

    -   **(i) Pay-as-you-go Plan**

        -   **Data Transfer Costs**: Transferring 1 petabyte (1,024
            terabytes) of data using IBM Aspera\'s Pay As You Go plan
            would cost approximately **\$1,034,240** at a rate of \$1.01
            per gigabyte.

        -   **Storage Fees**: Storage costs are \$0.03 per gigabyte per
            month, amounting to approximately **\$30,720 per month** for
            1 PB of data.

        -   **Additional Charges**: This estimate does not include
            potential extra costs for features such as encryption,
            preprocessing, or other services during the transfer
            process.

    -   **(ii) Short-term Subscription (Essentials Edition):**

        -   The Essentials Edition plan starts at **\$250.20 per
            terabyte annually**, with a minimum commitment of 1 TB.

        -   **Scalability Limitation**: Given the scale of transferring
            1+ PB, this plan is not a practical option due to the high
            annual cost and limited flexibility for large-scale,
            one-time migrations.

-   **(5) Comparison with Alternatives**:

    -   \(a\) [AWS Snowball](https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/) or AWS
        DataSync for bulk data migration, which is more cost-effective
        for one-time transfers.

-   **(6) Summary:**

    -   \(a\) IBM Aspera is relatively expensive for one-time large data
        migrations compared to AWS Snowball. It may be a more suitable
        option for smaller data migrations for short-term usage.

        -   \(i\)  There are missions that have leveraged AWS Snowball
            for large-scale data migrations, making it a more
            cost-effective and practical choice for similar scenarios.
